ATmega32U4 USB HID Audio Controller using LUFA Library.

This is a heavily modified version of "MediaController" project in the LUFA Library "Projects" directory.

 * Combined *.[ch] files into one single file for my understanding.
 * Only "Volume Up", "Volume Down" and "Mute" buttons work.
 * Changed the HID descriptor bytes.
 * Changed the USB PID/VID to my own.
